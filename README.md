## About
First of all Assassin's Genesis is not the next version of Assassin's Creed. Unfortunately Ubisoft didn't pay me any money, so basically I don't care about them. All you need to know that this project is made with my own fair hands and I'm proud of it. It's created via **SFML** multimedia and **SDL_Mixer** audio library completed with **c++** language. Two frustrating things is no-resizable window and lack of system which checks files before application starts. Website based on materialize framework which looks awesome. I used **sfml-network** which is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. By **HTTP POST** application submits data to be processed to a specified resource. Ok, that's all, have fun with game and see your scores [here](http://ag2d.netne.net/#section4)!

## Download
Application is available for windows users and linux-familiar people. You have two buttons under the picture, choose one of them to download. You might want to download only pictures, .mp3, .wav files then just click on button with label "files". Whole code is forthcoming, click on button "code". The next two buttons give you dll's. First means **B**-**b**asic .dll's, second means **E**-in case of **e**rror .dll's. Basic contains the same .dll's like in windows folder. Good luck! Contact me in case of questions **adrmic98@gmail.com**.

### SFML
I used [this](https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.4.2-windows-gcc-6.1.0-mingw-32-bit.zip) SFML 2.4.2 (GCC 6.1.0 MinGW (DW2) - 32-bit) according to [this](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/6.1.0/threads-posix/dwarf/i686-6.1.0-release-posix-dwarf-rt_v5-rev0.7z/download) compiler (MinGW Builds 6.1.0 (32-bit)).

### SDL_Mixer
I used SDL_Mixer from this [site](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/). Before I get started with SFML I've been learing SDL basics with [this](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php). Lazy foo helped me a lot.
