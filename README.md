## About
First of all Assassin's Genesis is not the next version of Assassin's Creed. Unfortunately Ubisoft didn't pay me any money, so basically I don't care about them. All you need to know is that this project is made with my own fair hands and I'm proud of it. It's created via SFML multimedia and SDL_Mixer audio library completed with c++ language. Two frustrating things is no-rezising window and no-checking files before application starts. I wish I finished this project soon but now just try what I have. Btw remember that there are no bugs there are features!
